Here’s a **complete roadmap** of **React topics** you should learn, from **beginner to advanced**, with a suggested order. This is ideal for a beginner to gradually move toward becoming an advanced React developer.

---

## ✅ **Beginner Level** (Foundations)

> Start here if you're completely new to React.

### 🔹 1. **JavaScript Fundamentals (Prerequisite)**

Before diving into React, make sure you're confident with:

* Variables (`let`, `const`)
* Arrow functions
* Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
* Destructuring
* Spread and rest operators
* ES6 Modules (`import`, `export`)
* Promises, async/await
* DOM basics

### 🔹 2. **React Basics**

* What is React and why use it?  ✅
* Create React App / Vite setup  ✅
* JSX syntax  ✅
* Components (Function-based)  ✅
* Props and how to pass data  ✅
* State with `useState`  ✅
* Event handling (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.)
* Conditional rendering
* List rendering with `.map()`
* Forms and form inputs

### 🔹 3. **Component Structure**

* Reusable components
* Component folder structure
* Smart (container) vs Dumb (presentational) components

---

## 🧩 **Intermediate Level**

> At this stage, you're building apps with multiple components and state handling.

### 🔹 4. **Hooks**

* `useState`
* `useEffect` (side effects, API calls)
* `useRef`
* `useContext` (React Context API)

### 🔹 5. **Routing**

* React Router (v6+)

  * `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, `<Link>`, `<Navigate>`
  * URL parameters
  * Nested routes
  * Redirects

### 🔹 6. **Forms**

* Controlled vs uncontrolled components
* Form validation basics
* Libraries: `Formik`, `React Hook Form` (optional)

### 🔹 7. **API Integration**

* `fetch` / `axios`
* `useEffect` for data fetching
* Handling loading, error states
* CRUD operations

### 🔹 8. **State Management**

* Lifting state up
* Prop drilling
* Context API
* Intro to Redux (or Zustand, Recoil, Jotai – modern alternatives)

### 🔹 9. **Styling**

* CSS Modules
* Styled Components
* Tailwind CSS (popular)
* Emotion or SCSS (optional)

---

## 🚀 **Advanced Level**

> These topics help you build scalable, high-performance apps.

### 🔹 10. **Advanced Hooks**

* `useMemo`
* `useCallback`
* `useReducer`
* Custom hooks

### 🔹 11. **Performance Optimization**

* React.memo
* Code splitting (lazy loading)
* Debouncing and throttling
* Virtualization (e.g., `react-window`)

### 🔹 12. **Testing**

* Unit testing with Jest
* Component testing with React Testing Library
* End-to-end testing (Cypress, Playwright)

### 🔹 13. **State Management Libraries**

* Redux (with `@reduxjs/toolkit`)
* Zustand
* Recoil / Jotai

### 🔹 14. **TypeScript with React**

* Type safety for props and state
* Generics in hooks
* Typing events and API data

### 🔹 15. **Server-Side and Full Stack**

* Next.js (React Framework)
* SSR vs CSR vs SSG
* API routes in Next.js
* Full-stack apps (with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, etc.)

## 🛠️ **Bonus / Optional Topics**

* React Native (for mobile apps)
* WebSockets / real-time apps
* PWA (Progressive Web Apps)
* Micro-frontends
* Monorepos (Turborepo, Nx)
* Design Systems (Storybook)

---

## 📚 Suggested Learning Path:

1. **Build small projects** like a counter, to-do list, and weather app.
2. Gradually build **larger apps** (blog, e-commerce site, dashboard).
3. Start using **API** and **routing**.
4. Learn **Redux or Zustand**.
5. Then explore **Next.js, TypeScript, testing**, and performance.
