That’s a great mindset, Bala — slow and steady with deep understanding is the best way to master React and JavaScript for real-world development. Here’s a **90-Day React + JavaScript Learning Roadmap**, broken down into **3 phases**, with clear **weekly goals**, **topics**, and **practical tasks**. This path assumes you already know HTML/CSS and basic JavaScript (variables, functions, if-else, loops).

* **Practice:** Build a login and signup form with validation.

---

### 🚀 **Phase 3: Real-World React (Days 61–90)**

#### 🗓️ Week 9 – React Router

* ✅ `react-router-dom` basics
* ✅ Route, Link, useParams, useNavigate

* ✅ Pagination and filters
* **Practice:** Build a dashboard that lists items from an API.

#### 🗓️ Week 12 – Optimization & Deployment
