Great question! In an interview, your answer should be **clear**, **confident**, and **simple** — especially for something like `useRef`. Here’s how you can answer it **orally**:

---

## ✅ Simple & Strong Answer for Interviews:

> **“`useRef` is a React hook that allows us to reference DOM elements directly or store mutable values that persist across renders without causing re-renders. It’s commonly used for things like focusing an input, scrolling to a section, playing media, or storing timer IDs or previous values.”**

## 🧠 Want to make it sound more natural?

Here’s a step-by-step version you can speak smoothly:

> “In React, `useRef` is a hook that gives us a way to reference elements in the DOM directly — like an input or a div — so we can do things like focus the input or scroll to a section.
>
> It can also be used to store a value that we want to keep between renders, like a timer ID or the previous value of a state, without triggering a re-render.”

---

## ✅ If they ask for an example, you can say:

> “For example, if I want to focus an input field when a form opens, I use `useRef` to point to the input, and then call `ref.current.focus()` inside `useEffect`.”

---

## 🔁 Bonus (short version):

> “`useRef` is used to reference DOM elements or store values that should not cause re-renders. It’s great for focusing inputs, scrolling, media control, and saving values like timers.”
