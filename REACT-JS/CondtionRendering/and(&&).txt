Great question, Bala! Let’s focus on this line:

```jsx
{show && <p>Hello, welcome to React!</p>}
```

This is called **conditional rendering** using the **`&&` (AND) operator** in React.

---

## 💡 How it works:

```jsx
{condition && somethingToRender}
```

### 🔹 If `condition` is **true**:

✅ It shows `somethingToRender` on the screen.

### 🔹 If `condition` is **false**:

❌ It **does not show anything** — nothing is displayed, not even blank space.

---

## 🧪 Real Example:

### 🟢 When `show = true`:

```jsx
{true && <p>Hello, welcome to React!</p>}
```

👉 Output: ✅ You will see this text:
**"Hello, welcome to React!"**

---

### 🔴 When `show = false`:

```jsx
{false && <p>Hello, welcome to React!</p>}
```

👉 Output: ❌ Nothing will be shown. The `<p>` element is **skipped completely**.

---

### ✅ Summary:

| `show` value | What you see            |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| `true`       | `<p>` is displayed      |
| `false`      | Nothing is shown at all |

---

This is a **clean and simple way** to show or hide something in React without writing extra if-else statements.

Let me know if you want to try this with another element like an image or input box for practice!
