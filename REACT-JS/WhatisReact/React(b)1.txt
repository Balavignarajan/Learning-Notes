1. ðŸŒŸ What is React?

React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially for web apps.
Think of React as a tool that helps you build websites like Lego blocks â€” piece by piece, cleanly and efficiently.


2. ðŸ§  Why use React?

*Imagine you want to build a website like Facebook, Instagram, or a dashboard:*

    >The page has many parts (posts, comments, likes, profiles).

    >These parts update without refreshing the whole page.

    >React helps manage those parts, so your website runs fast and smooth.
