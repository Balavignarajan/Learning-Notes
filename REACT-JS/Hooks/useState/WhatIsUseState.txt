🧠 1. What is useState in React?
👉 Simple answer:

useState is a React Hook that lets your component store and manage data (called state).

Think of it like a box inside your component that remembers a value — and when the value changes, your component updates automatically.

🧐 2. Why do we use useState?

Because in React:

We build UI using components.

Components need to remember data, like:

A form input

A counter number

Whether something is visible or hidden

Without useState, the component forgets any changes once it re-renders.\

🗺️ 3. Where do we use it?

Inside functional components in React.

We use it when:

You want your UI to react to some data changes

You want to store temporary values like text, numbers, booleans

🔧 4. How to use useState?

1.

Let’s go step-by-step with a real example 👇
✅ Step 1: Import useState

import React, { useState } from 'react';

2.

✅ Step 2: Use it in a function component

function Counter() {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0) ; // 👈 state created

return (
<div>
<p>You clicked {count} times</p>
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click Me</button>
</div>
) ;
}

3.

🔍 Explanation:

const [count, setCount] = useState(0) ;

count: This is your state variable (starts at 0)

setCount: This is a function to change the value

useState(0): You give it a starting value

🔍 Explanation:
useState(0) → starts count at 0

setCount(count + 1) → increases value

React re-renders automatically on update

4.

🧠 How it works:

First time, count is 0

When button is clicked, setCount(count + 1) runs

React updates the count

The component re-renders and shows new count

| Example | What useState stores |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| A login form | Username, password, error message |
| A todo app | List of tasks |
| A shopping cart | Number of items in cart |
| Theme toggle | Dark/Light mode (true/false) |
| Modal | Whether it's open or not |
