The main difference between a **normal variable** and **`useState`** is that **`useState`** keeps track of changes and makes sure your app re-renders when the value changes, while a normal variable does not.

### Here's the breakdown:

1. **Normal Variable**:

   * It's just a regular value in your code (like `let color = "red";`).
   * If you change it, nothing in your app updates automatically. React won't know about the change.
2. **`useState`**:

   * It's a special hook in React that not only stores a value but also **signals React to update the UI** when the value changes.
   * When you change the state (using the setter function), React re-renders the part of the app that uses that state.

### Example:

* **Normal Variable**:

  ```js
  let color = "red";
  color = "blue"; // This changes the value, but React doesn't know about it.
  ```

* **`useState`**:

  ```js
  const [color, setColor] = useState("red");
  setColor("blue"); // This changes the value and updates the UI!
  ```

### Summary:

* **Normal variable**: No re-render.
* **`useState`**: Re-renders the app when the value changes.
