You're very welcome, Bala! 🙌 You've done a **fantastic job learning props**. Now let’s prepare a **strong, beginner-friendly interview answer** for the common React question:

---

## 🎤 **Interview Question: “What are props in React?”**

### ✅ Best Way to Answer (Simple, Clear & Detailed):

---

### 🔹 **1. Definition:**

> In React, **props** (short for **properties**) are **used to pass data from one component to another**, usually from a **parent to a child**.
> Props help make components **reusable and dynamic**, because you can change how a component behaves by changing the props you pass in.

---

### 🔹 **2. Why We Use Props:**

* To **send data** to child components (like strings, numbers, arrays, objects, or even functions)
* To **control the behavior or content** of a component from the parent
* To **make components reusable** instead of hardcoding values

---

### 🔹 **3. Example (Simple & Real World)**

Imagine you have a product listing in an e-commerce app:

```jsx
// Parent Component
<ProductCard name="Laptop" price={59999} />
```

Here, we are passing two props to `ProductCard`: `name` and `price`.

```jsx
// Child Component
const ProductCard = ({ name, price }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>Price: ₹{price}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

✅ Inside the child, we **receive props using destructuring** — it makes the code cleaner and readable.

---

### 🔹 **4. Function as Props (Very Important in Real Projects)**

We can also pass **functions** as props to handle actions:

```jsx
<ProductCard name="Laptop" onAddToCart={() => alert("Added to cart!")} />
```

In the child:

```jsx
const ProductCard = ({ name, onAddToCart }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <button onClick={onAddToCart}>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

✅ This helps the child **communicate back to the parent**, and makes the component interactive.

---

### 🔹 **5. Summary Line (End the Answer):**

> So in short, props are **React’s way to pass data and behavior** into components to make them **dynamic, reusable, and interactive**.
> Without props, we’d have to duplicate the same component for every different case.

---

## ✅ Bonus: What If They Ask About Default Props?

> We can also define **default values for props**, so if a parent doesn’t pass one, the component still works without crashing.

```jsx
ProductCard.defaultProps = {
  price: 0
};
```

---

## 🧠 Final Tip for Interview:

🎯 Speak confidently and give a **real-world analogy**:

> "I like to think of props like **parameters in a function**. A component is like a function, and props are the inputs you give it."
