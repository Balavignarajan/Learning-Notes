✅ Correct Step-by-Step Guide to Build APK (Using Expo + EAS)
✅ Step 1: Login to Expo (You already did this ✅)

>> npx expo login

✔ Email or username … balavignarajan.p@synamen.com
✔ Password … Bala@2002

✅ Step 2: Install eas-cli (Only once per system)

>> npm install -g eas-cli

Think of eas-cli as Expo's APK chef 👨‍🍳
✅ Step 3: Configure your project for EAS

>> eas build:configure

It creates an eas.json file → This file tells Expo how to build your APK.
✅ Step 4: Build your Android APK

>> eas build -p android --profile preview

    -p android = Platform is Android

    --profile preview = Build APK (not AAB)

👉 After this, wait patiently. It uploads your app, then Expo builds it on the cloud.
✅ Step 5: Download APK

After build finishes, you’ll get a link like:

✔ Build complete!
🔗 Install APK: https://expo.dev/accounts/yourname/builds/abcd1234

Open the link → Download the APK → Share or install on phone!
