1. ***SafeAreaView***
[
import { SafeAreaView, Text } from "react-native-safe-area-context";

<SafeAreaView>
<Text>Hello World</Text>
</SafeAreaView>

>>
**SafeAreaView is just like a View, but it adds padding automatically so that content stays inside safe zones.
**Prevents overlap with:
**iPhone notch
**Status bar
**Home indicator area (bottom)

2. ***View***
[
import { View, Text } from "react-native";

export default function Demo() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: "lightblue" }}>
      <Text>Hello World</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
ðŸ”¹ View
View is the basic building block in React Native.
Think of it like a div in web development.
It does not care about notches, status bars, or safe zones.
Whatever you put inside, it renders at the exact position (top, left, etc.).
On an iPhone with a notch â†’ the text might overlap with the notch or status bar.
