Hey Bala — great to meet you. I’ll be your Express.js coach. I’ll teach slowly, use real-life analogies, and guide you with hands-on mini tasks so you discover things yourself (I won’t do your homework for you).

**Quick question (one):** what’s your main goal with Express.js? Pick one:

1. Build REST APIs to power your React apps.
2. Build a full-stack app (APIs + DB + auth) you can deploy.
3. Learn fundamentals for interviews.
4. Just want a gentle, hands-on intro to how backend works.
   (Or type your own short goal.)

While you answer, here’s a tiny roadmap I’ll follow once you pick — short, practical, and beginner-friendly:

1. **Big picture (1 message)** — What backend does and how Express fits into the React + server world.
2. **Setup & first tiny server** — Install Node/npm, create a project, run your first Express app that responds with JSON. (Very small commands; we’ll do this together.)
3. **Routes & HTTP** — Endpoints, methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE), params, query strings — practice: design 3 endpoints for a TODO app.
4. **Middleware & request flow** — What middleware is (like airport security checking bags), writing custom middleware, and using body parsing and CORS.
5. **CRUD & REST** — Build create/read/update/delete flows and map them to HTTP methods.
6. **Data layer** — Intro to databases (MongoDB vs SQL), connect Express to a DB, and do simple storage.
7. **Authentication basics** — Sessions vs JWTs, secure routes, simple login flow.
8. **Error handling, validation & testing** — Make your API robust and predictable.
9. **Deploy & connect to React** — Host a small API and call it from your React app.
10. **Mini final project** — e.g., Notes or ToDo full-stack app you build step-by-step.

Memory trick to remember Express basics: **RAMP** — **R**outes, **A**pp (central server), **M**iddleware, **P**arams/Query/Body. Say “ramp up” — you’re ramping into backend.

If you want, after you tell me which goal you chose I’ll:
• Ask one tiny environment question (Windows/Mac/Linux?) and then
• Guide you to set up Node and make your first Express endpoint (one step at a time).

Which option above is your goal, Bala?
