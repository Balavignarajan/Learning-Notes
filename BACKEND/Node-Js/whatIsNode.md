1) Quick plain-language intro

Backend = server-side code. It runs on a computer (server) and answers requests from clients (like a browser or a mobile app).

Node.js lets you run JavaScript on that server.

Express is a small toolkit (framework) that makes building server endpoints with Node much easier.

Together you can build APIs (data endpoints), handle authentication, store data in databases, and deploy apps people can use.
