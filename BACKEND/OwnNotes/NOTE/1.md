1. firstly i was created a express project with 
     - npm init -y
     - npx express install (for installing express js)
     - nodemon install (for auto restrart backend)

2. I was using some routes concept 
     - "/" (home screen)
     - "/"  about
     - and also some dynamic routing

3. I was creating todo-crud application
     - get,post,put,delete.
     - in that i was using only in index.js file and create a function for each.
     - And i was checked in postman with localhost:3000 it was working.
     - and then i created a new react project to connect backend.
     - while the connecting is the simple thing in api call just run both frontend and backend.
     - in api call use it 
           const response = await axios.get("http://localhost:3000/todos");
     - It was working and i am doing this without connecting db only stored in array in future we will connect the db.
